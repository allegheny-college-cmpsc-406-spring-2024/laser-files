# Making Files for Laser Cutter

In this demo, we'll get some quick practice designing files for the laser cutter. Each person will make a small design in Adobe Illustrator that the professor will cut on the laser cutter. 

You can reference [this link](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-406-spring-2024/laer-cut-wheel-example) in the laser cutter demo and explanation.

> By default, professor will supervise all laser cuts. If you plant to use the laser cutter a lot, you may request authorization to use it on your own, and I will train you in more detail. 

# Instructions

1. Create a new file in Illustrator. 

2. Set the color mode to RGB by selecting File>Document Color Mode>RGB Color

3. Create a design with rasterex text inside of a vector cut shape that is 2" X 2" or less. Remember a *raster* is a pixel shape and will be burned into the material pixel by pixel. A *vector* is a line shape and will be cut into the board in a continuous line. (See example above for more info)

4. Set the rastered text's fill to black. 

5. Set the vector line's color to pure red (hex #FF0000 or RGB (255, 0, 0)) and its line weight to 0.001. 

6. Save your work to `<your_first_name>.ai` and upload it to [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AGZUj6FKIxE-EstXafklDarH_8WXH7qH?usp=drive_link) on Google Drive.
